# Spawn Server

This Rust library permits to execute programs without replying on `fork`. This crate exports macros `srpc!` (synchronous) and `arpc!` (asynchronous) that is similar to macro `sh!`. Have a look in the examples directory on how to use this macro.

## Usage

Use macro `srpc!` to send requests to the spawn server. This is a synchronous call. For asynchronous calls, use macro `arpc!`. Import these macros in your Rust program as follows:

```rust
use spawn_server::{arpc, srpc};
```

Also, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
spawn_server = { version="*", git = "https://github.com/scontain/spawn_server.git" }
```

## Deployment

You should run the spawn server in the same container as the program that uses the spawn server. The spawn server will - for now - use port 8099.

## Build

Just execute `cargo build --release` to build the spawn server. 


## Examples

Blocking execution of programs:

```bash
cargo run --example blocking
```

Asychronous execution of programs:

```bash
cargo run --example async
```
